    content="Dune Legacy is an effort by a handful of developers to revitalize the first-ever real-time strategy game. The original game was the basis for the hugely successful Command and Conquer series, and the gameplay has been replicated an extended to a wide variety of storylines and series. Lead one of three interplanetary houses, Atreides, Harkonnen or Ordos, in an attempt to harvest the largest amount of spice from the sand dunes. Exchange your spice stockpiles for credits through refinement and build an army capable of thwarting attempts of the other houses to stop your harvesting!">

              <p>
                After 6 years, 0.97.0 is being released with some minor changes & campaign AI difficulty reduction. So far only for Windows: <a href="downloads.html">download</a>.
              </p>
              <p>Changes: </p>

							<ul>
								<li>Significantly reduced default quantbot medium in campaign, it now only attacks with 3 units at a time</li>
                <li>Fixed ornithopters to fly properly again, there's still a few bugs to make them work properly</li>
                <li>Fixed buy where sand worms immediately attack at game start</li>
								<li>New reworked campaign scenario maps by Dimitri, provide feedback to dmitrif AT bk.ru</li>
								<li>Other tweaks to quantbot, such as considering max units</li>
								<li>A new campaign AI by Richard</li>
								<li>Cleanup of SDL2 libraries and library references</li>
								<li>in keeping with original game, units only return to original repair locaiton if 'manual carryall drop' is enabled. This is similar to original and also - returning to battle zone is a bit imbalanced - allows for snowballing</li>
							</ul>

              <p>After quite a longish development cycle and many new, interesting features being implemented the next
                version of Dune Legacy is ready for <a href="downloads.html">download</a>.</p>

              <p>Main changes: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>New AI Smart Bot and Quant Bot</li>
                <li>Port to SDL 2</li>
                <li>Use hardware acceleration for drawing</li>
                <li>HD graphics: Use mask overlays to generate <a href="hd-graphics-for-dune-legacy.html">high-res
                    graphics</a> out of the low-res ones of the original game</li>
                <li>Maximum number of units per house (either map dependent or as a new game option "override maximum
                  number of units")</li>
                <li>Use a smaller logical resolution for high resolution displays, e.g. 960x540 for 1920x1080</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Further changes: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Move to fix-point math for game logic as floating-point operations may differ between platforms and
                  compilers</li>
                <li>Units entering refineries or repair yards are now moving onto the structure tile before disappearing
                </li>
                <li>ADL music playback replaced: Now combines ScummVM AdlibDriver with Woody OPL chip emulation code

                <li>Improve performance of Fog of War</li>
                <li>Units can now be instructed to find the next repair yard on their own</li>
                <li>Save game speed, scroll speed and sound volume as game settings</li>
                <li>In campaign mode, the map choice screen remembers the region of a failed mission (the user has to
                  select a different region)</li>
                <li>New game option "Manual Carryall Drops"</li>
                <li>Mentat's eyes are following the cursor</li>
                <li>Clicking on mentat's eyes makes him blink and clicking on mentat's mouth makes him open it</li>
                <li>Modding: Make it possible to disable a unit or structure</li>
                <li>Save screenshots as PNG</li>

              <h2 id="2016-09-04-00-00-00">HD graphics for Dune Legacy</h2>
            </div>

              <p>
                Dune 2 has, due to its age, graphics with very low resolution, e.g. a map tile in the DOS version is
                only 16x16 pixels. For those of you who like this pixelated look&feel of the original game, Dune Legacy
                offers the option to use the original graphics. But Dune Legacy also allows to use the pixel-art scaler
                Scale2x that tries to reduce the pixelated appearance of the original graphics. Sometimes this leads to
                corners being rounded off, resulting in a cartoonish look.

                Two years ago sourceforge user Assembler Bot contacted me with a solution to this problem: "I have
                almost all bitmaps from old Dune2 up-scaled 3x and carefully pixel-by-pixel smoothed to resemble
                original bitmaps as close as possible." Some graphics were still missing which I created in the course
                of the last months. Arranging those high-res graphics to be useful for Dune Legacy also took some time.
                Due to copyright issue it wasn't possible to include the graphics directly, but a masking technique was
                developed: The mask is applied to the original low-res image to create an high-res version. The next
                version of Dune Legacy will contain (the option) to use those graphics. Screenshots bellow allow you to
                compare both versions for yourself via the sliders:

              <p>Newer versions of Mac OS X seem to have various things changed in a way that it broke backwards
                compatibility with SDL-based games. Jeffrey Carpenter looked into the issues and finally provided a
                patch to resolve the problem. The next release of Dune Legacy hopefully will run out of the box on
                current Mac OS X versions but in the meantime take a look at the install instructions provided by
                Jeffrey in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/dunelegacy/bugs/51/">Bug #51</a>.</p>

              <p>Our new wiki is based upon the Hosted Apps Service provided by SourceForge.net. This eases website
                management as we do not have to upgrade the wiki software on our own in the future but can rely on
                SourceForge. While moving the wiki pages we cleaned up and removed outdated/obsolete entries.
                Furthermore we added some additional pages like a Manual and revamped the Development section.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately the wiki accounts could not be transferred because the Hosted Apps on SourceForge are
                connected to SourceForge accounts. Thus you will need to get an SourceForge account in order to edit our

              <p>This branch was forked from dunelegacy-0.93 IIRC. It's main goal is to restructure the game to increase
                it's code quality. This task is not finishd yet but there where several modifications. The biggest
                changes are:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>All Game Data is now loaded out of the original Dune II PAK-Files (+ one additional LEGACY.PAK
                  File). There is no longer a need to extract the data with an external program.</li>
                <li>The Menu-Code has been rewritten.</li>
                <li>The GUI-Code has been rewritten and extended.</li>
                <li>The music is converted from the original Dune II *.ADL or *.XMI Files. These files are converted to
                  WAV-Files. It is still possible to use other files as background music (Download high-quality
                  mp3-files here)</li>
                <li>The configuration is loaded from "Dune Legacy.ini"</li>
                <li>The interface for the Structures and Units had been redesigned to seperate functionality of a
                  Unit/Structure and it's interface</li>
                <li>The SFX is loaded from PAK-Files and upsampled</li>
                <li>The save games are now saved platform independent (endian-safe and 64-bit safe)</li>
                <li>Save as many savegames as you like</li>
                <li>The campaign works like in the original Dune II</li>
                <li>Changed the unit/structure data to be like in the original</li>
                <li>Unit/Structure data is loaded from a file</li>
                <li>The whole game is now based on a single random number generator and thus reproducable</li>
                <li>Replays are now possible</li>
                <li>A lot of small graphical effects (Explosions, tracks on sand, dead infantry) where added</li>
                <li>The game is very stable now</li>
                <li>Many smaller bugfixes</li>
              </ul>
